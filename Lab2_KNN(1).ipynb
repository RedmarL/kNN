    "## 1 The data\n",
    "\n",
    "We look at data originally from an Australian bank. Based on some information of a customer, the bank has to decide whether this customer's application for a credit card will be approved or not.\n",
    "(The original data file can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(Australian+Credit+Approval), but for convenience we have already provided two .txt files with this assignment.)\n",
    "The customer data of each customer is described by 14 variables. Four of these are categorical variables: they assign a label to each customer. These labels are represented by integers. (To protect the privacy of the customers, there is no information about the meaning of the variables and thus not about the meaning of the different labels.) Four other variables are binary (0 or 1). The other six variables are real numbers. Together they constitute the input: the vector *x*.\n",
    "Each customer also has their output variable *y*, which is 0 or 1. This indicates whether the customer's application (according to human experts) should be approved (*y=1*) or not (*y=0*).\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to write an algorithm for this task that learns from the expert decisions it has seen and is able to make its own decisions for new customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2 The algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The Nearest Neighbour algorithm is based on a simple idea: we are going to base the decision for a new customer (assign credit card or not) on the decision for a customer in the training data (the historical data). We base it on the customer who is most similar to the new customer.\n",
    "To use this in an algorithm, we first need a measure which can be used to determine the similarity between two customers. We will use the *Euclidean* distance for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider a customer to be a point in a 14-dimensional space (one dimension for each variable), we can calculate the Euclidean distance between two customers/points *A* and *B* with:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sqrt{(A_1-B_1)^2+(A_2-B_2)^2+...+(A_{14}-B_{14})^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $A_1$ the first input variable of $A$, $A_2$ the second, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm has the following simple steps, with step 3 being an evaluation of how well the algorithm is doing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the training data from the file;\n",
    "2. For every customer $c_{test}$ in the test file: determine which customer $c_{train}$ in the training data has the smallest Euclidean distance to the test-customer $c_{test}$, and assign the decision corresponding to $c_{train}$ to $c_{test}$;\n",
    "3. Count the number of test-customers for which the decision made by the algorithm is the same as the decision made by human experts;\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1 is already implemented below in the two classes **Data** and **Person**.\n",
    "Person is a class containing all customer information: the input vector *x* and the output *y*. The inputs are divided in three different arrays: *xCategorical*, *xBinary* and *xReal*; the output is *y*."
